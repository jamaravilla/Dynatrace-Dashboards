## User Action Linear Weighted Forecast Analysis
This dashboard pack provides a forecast for user actions (Duration, Visually Complete and Speed Index) over five weeks of historical data. The forecst calculation uses a linear projection, but keep in mind that forecasting uses just 5 datapoints. This will soon be replaced with a version that uses 35 datapoints. It you need the 35 datapoint version, please reach out at john.kelly@dynatrace.com.
